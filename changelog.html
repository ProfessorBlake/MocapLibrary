This feature uses <a href='https://firebase.google.com/'>Google Firebase</a> realtime database to to store a JSON list of data about each asset in the library.<br> There isn't any kind of measure in place to store which assets a user has liked, because no user information is saved at all, so a use can like an asset as much as they like. The only minor preventative measure that prevents spamming the like button is a client-side check to see if they've liked the asset in their current session. If they reload the page, they can like the asset again. But the likes are just for fun so it shouldn't cause any problems."
